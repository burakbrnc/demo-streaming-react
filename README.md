- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
    I picked the simplest thing that does the job well. React + Vite for a fast, no-nonsense setup, 
    three page files because it is asked, no router library just hash routing; this causes few
    features but this app is supposed to be simple and readable so thats what I used. 
    Each page fetches the feed (remote first, local if remote doesn't work),
    filters year as 2010+ and by type, sorts by title, and shows 21 items.
